## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No server required - runs entirely in the browser

### Installation & Setup
1. **Clone or download** the project files
2. **Open** `index.html` in your web browser
3. **Start playing** immediately - no additional setup required!

### Development Setup
For development with live reloading:

1. Use `Open with Live Server`, to open the file `index.html`. It will load the file in browser and it would do live reload
2. Try command line
```bash
# Using Python's built-in server
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js serve package
npx serve .

# Using any other static file server
# Then open http://localhost:8000
```

## üéØ How to Play

### Basic Rules
1. **Players take turns** rolling the dice by clicking "ROLL DICE"
2. **Move your piece** the number of squares shown on the dice
3. **Special squares**:
   - **Fish squares** (ü¶à): Move down to the fish's tail position
   - **Boat squares** (‚õµ): Move up to the boat's destination
4. **Extra turns**: Rolling a 1 gives you another turn
5. **Winning**: First player to land exactly on square 100 wins

### Game Controls

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **HTML5** - Semantic structure with mobile-optimized meta tags
- **CSS3** - Grid layout, animations, and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No external dependencies, ES6+ features

### Game Architecture
- **Class-based design** with `FishBoatLaddersGame` main class
- **Event-driven** user interactions with proper event handling
- **State management** using localStorage for persistence
- **Modular methods** for board creation, player movement, and UI updates

### Key Components
- **Board Generation**: Creates 100-square grid in zigzag pattern
- **Piece Movement**: Smooth CSS transitions with collision detection
- **Special Squares**: Fish and boat mechanics with visual feedback
- **Audio System**: Web Audio API for game sound effects
- **Storage System**: JSON-based localStorage for game state and statistics

### Performance Features
- **Selective animations** - only relevant fish/boats animate
- **Efficient DOM updates** - minimal redraws and targeted updates
- **Optimized mobile layout** - no scrolling required
- **Fast loading** - no external dependencies or large assets

## üé® Customization

### Game Rules
Modify constants in `script.js`:
```javascript
static EXTRA_TURN_ROLL = 1;     // Change extra turn trigger
static ANIMATION_RANGE = 20;    // Adjust animation distance
static WINNING_SQUARE = 100;    // Modify win condition
```

### Visual Styling
Edit `style.css` for:
- **Colors and themes** - Update CSS custom properties
- **Animation speeds** - Modify transition durations
- **Layout spacing** - Adjust margins and padding
- **Responsive breakpoints** - Change mobile view triggers

### Game Features
Extend functionality in `script.js`:
- **Add new sound effects** using the `playSound()` method
- **Create custom notifications** with `showNotification()`
- **Modify fish/boat positions** in constructor arrays
- **Add new game modes** by extending the class

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Game doesn't load**: Ensure you're opening `index.html` in a browser, not viewing the file
- **Sounds don't play**: Check browser audio permissions and volume settings
- **Mobile layout issues**: Verify viewport meta tag is present in HTML
- **State not saving**: Check if localStorage is enabled in browser settings

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support for all features
- **Firefox**: Full support for all features
- **Safari**: Full support (mobile Safari included)
- **Mobile browsers**: Optimized for touch interactions

### Performance Tips
- **Clear browser cache** if experiencing display issues
