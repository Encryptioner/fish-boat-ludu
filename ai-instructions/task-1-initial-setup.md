4. It will have the instructions and game logic similar to the link
5. You may play the game there and understand the game functionality
6. Then make a simplified clone  with the required variation by removing unnecessary clutter which are not necessary to play and understand the game

### Comments

2. The funcationality seems broke


## Instruction List 4

## Instruction List 5

### Instructions
1. There are snake and ladder instead of boat and fish
2. Those are out of the board
3. The dice positions are not according to the score
4. The calucaltaiton seems off design seems novice
5. Assess the requirement carefully. Follow the game from this link https://www.crazygames.com/game/snakes-and-ladders 
6. I want professional, playable, shareable game

### Comments
1. It made the design better but again fish and boat are showing only on a board cell, not over the whole board
2. Without this, the logic seems unpredictable.
3. For example: When player one reaches to square 47, it goes to 84. but how?

## Instruction List 6

### Instructions
1. Check the current implementations http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html
2. It looks good, but the fish and boat should be over multiple cells where start and end point will indicate from where to where the player will go. Fish will eat and move to tail. Boat will take high ground
3. Ensure the game follows the same rules and visuals like snake ladder game. Just snake and ladder will be replaced by fish and boat.
