### Comments
1. AI created a board game. which looks good. but the it is not the required varaint. The boat and fish shows only on a specific board number. not expanding throughout the board. Also the ui doesn't show the guti
2. AI did designed good but not functional

2. The functionality seems broke

5. Assess the requirement carefully. Follow the game from this link https://www.crazygames.com/game/snakes-and-ladders 
6. I want professional, playable, shareable game

### Comments
1. It made the design better but again fish and boat are showing only on a board cell, not over the whole board
2. Without this, the logic seems unpredictable.
3. For example: When player one reaches to square 47, it goes to 84. but how?


## Instruction List 6

### Instructions
1. Check the current implementations http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html
2. It looks good, but the fish and boat should be over multiple cells where start and end point will indicate from where to where the player will go. Fish will eat and move to tail. Boat will take high ground

4. I have added screenshots too for viewing the current design and expected design (ladder and snake will be replaced)

### Comments
1. Seems it is understanding the goal. However. the boat and fish doesn't look good
2. It kept the icons in cells and Created lines between those cells to connect them.


## Instruction List 7

### Instructions
1. Looks better however, I expected better design for boat and fish
2. And the fish and boat seems too fat. Make them better looking
3. Also, it would be good, when fish eats or player finds a boat, show necessary notifications at bottom. It doesn't say, what will happen when these tasks happen.
4. And there should have option to view the history/stats of each move for each game. However, it shouldn't occupy the page view. It should only show, when history button is clicked
5. And, when the website reloads, the game starts from start. It should persist the state.
6. If one want to reset, he should press the new game

2. There should have option to update player's name
3. In history, there should have timestamp

1. Instead of native confirmation popup, design something which looks good
2. It is a game, so design should be attractive and addictive
3. The thick design doesn't look that good. The number is hard to read
4. And in mobile UI, the number of cells are not understandable.
5. And did u checked instruction list 8 carefully. It stated that, When rolled 1, it should give option for extra turn instead of 6

### Comments
1. The design is better but not as expected
2. The mobile view needs to be improved

6. The design should be sleek, modern, clean and addictive with nice animations
7. It should be simple for play from child to old
8. And in history, the timestamp should in 12 hour

### Comments

## Instruction List 11

### Instructions
1. Bring back the earlier design. Seems u broke existing design
2. Just improve necessary functionality
3. In mobile view, the Who's turn shows at top before buttons and roll shows at bottom after board. It is not good UX. The who's turn should show next to roll

5. Ensure the design looks good in both mobile and web

### Comments
1. It failed to bring back the old design. The UI looks odd.
2. Seems it tried to make the boat as single items instead of connecting them

### Comments
1. It failed to read the screenshots which were present in desktop (mac)
2. Later, moved them to project directory

2. Will try updating design tomorrow


## Instruction List 14

### Instructions
1. The boat, fish icon has animation. Those are going out of the boards
2. Instead of being large and small animation for animation for all icons, the animation could only show for the next two/three fish and boat position. Then, visually it will be less distracting
3. The dice position of of players in board, is hard to find among the fish and boat. It should be visually good for better UX

### Comments
1. It did some work. Need to verify.
2. The bouncing effect still goes out of squeare
