# Guidelines

## Rules
1. Code like a pro developer
2. Ensure the code is optimized for all devices


## Instruction List 1

### Instructions
1. The code is not optimized for the mobile. There are issues. Figure out all issues
2. Some reported issues are, the UI lags, the style jumps, gradient color looks odd, scroll doesn't work smoothly, notification popup and menu options doesn't show smoothly.
3. Fix all the possible issues which can happen for mobile devices. Ensure it works smoothly in all kind of devices. High end laptop to low end mobile devices
4. Test the implementation carefully. Ensure all the functionality works as expected. For example, new game, history etc.

### Comments
1. AI did some update related to mobile optimization
2. Some gradient is also changed


## Instruction List 2

### Instructions
1. There is some blipping or shaking visuals in color which happens over the website, specially on header. It seems synchronized with the blipping of player position. Investigate it
2. Player position could blip for better attention but not the whole UI visual
3. Check if any more optimization could be possible to run the website smoothly
4. The website will later be used in webview of mobile app and published via google play store and app store. So consider that while developing

### Comments
1. AI did some update and it's seems better
2. Less blipping but still have issues


## Instruction List 3

### Instructions
1. Some animation and design need update. Investigate and give suggestion
2. In mobile, the square 100 has animation. But in mobile view, it seems just blipping. Animation is not visualized. It seems visible in desktop though
3. In mobile, player position seems little bit off outside the square in some cases (For ex: one player in 19 position feels ok, but on position 46 it feels off. It could happen to other positions too). Fix it
4. Test the app in mobile devices and desktop devices and ensure design, performance, logic everything is ok

### Comments
1. The animation is better and blipping of square 100 doesn't look bad now
2. I've tested it on mobile view of desktop browser so far
3. Will test in actual device after deployment
