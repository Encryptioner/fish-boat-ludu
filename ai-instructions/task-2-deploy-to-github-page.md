# Guidelines

## Rules
1. Deploy to github pages like a pro developer
2. Ensure the code and structure follows latest standard and maintainable


## Instruction List 1

### Instructions
1. Check the `../../frontend-vue3-boilerplate/` project
2. There I have already handled deploying github pages
3. It is a vue/vite frontend project, which required many steps. For this project, deploying should be simple
4. You can implement similarly or follow latest standards
5. Add the instructs for deployment in `../docs/` directory of this project.

### Comments
1. It created necessary files
2. The deployment guide needs some modification like update naming and remove unnecessary info


### Instruction List 2

### Instructions
1. Do I need a page deploy script similar to frontend-vue3-boilerplate?
2. And are there any security concern like exposing any secrets?
3. Update the deploy.yml file name to be more accurate. Something like deploy-to-github-pages.yml. Ensure updating wherever it is mentioned
4. I want the deployment when the code is pushed only to `release/prod` branch
